 REAL LIFE EXAMPLE
  - I have copied all deproj codes in the root of eclipse workspace.
  1. I just finished version and I want to deploy it.
   - First I create script update-VERSION.sh
   - Run deproj.sh cup project_name. Project_name means Eclipse project.
   - Now I update generated scripts (created in the project_name/updates/update-VERSION.sh). 
     Usually I don't have much work with that, becouse I usually have all project's modules in one directory 
     (for instance like ubercart).
   - Now I commit and push this changes.
  2. I have finalized version and I want save archived version release to the feature server.
   - Run deproj.sh cup project_name.
   - Pack is created in a root of workspace and you can upload it on a feature server 
     Previosly generated scritp will download data from this source.
  2.1 Now I go into dev, beta servers and run created update scripts there.
   - Do some testing and if is everyting OK, than run script on production server. 
  3. Now project is deployed, we need start new version
   - run deproj.sh pv NEW_VER
   - New version started.
